# Schedule

## First assignment!

This assignment is due on **August 7th, 2023**. You've got two options based on your availability. One is just the bare minimum, one is the full set of learning. This first assignment is a bit different than others since it's a lot of set-up, building motivation, etc.

**Do not try to implement Julia versions of the code in chapters 1-3 of the book, it will be hard.** Start at chapter 4.

We discussed this assignment briefly during our initial meeting, recorded [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BLLvpxez_c&t=86s).
