Here's some handy links and references.

## Programming Environment

You can find some information on getting your programming environment for the course up and running [here](/resources/programming-environment/).

## Cloud compute

- [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) seems to have some free GPU compute but it is often in use. Their paid GPUs units are reasonably priced, a P4000 is about 51 cents an hour.
- Google Colab has GPUs for free, but storage is not persistent and it can be a mild pain in the ass to set up with Julia. There's a guide on running Colab [here](/resources/programming-environment/).
- ~~~<a href="https://lambdalabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nooopener noreferrer">Lambda</a>~~~ has some very cheap compute. A reasonably powerful machine with a Quadro RTX 6000 is about 50 cents an hour (the cheapest they offer).
- [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) is a nice Julia option, but the GPU options are _really_ expensive ($8 per hour!) because the GPUs are __very__ good. I think if all you want to do is CPU-only compute, this is a pretty good option, but for learning it's probably too expensive.
